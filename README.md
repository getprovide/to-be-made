# To Be Made

There isn't anything here yet. Lendeavor is busy working on product
for our customers. As a result, we haven't had time to give any
open source software back to the world. This isn't ideal.

We would like to give back software. We're a really small team right
now though, and it's hard to find the time.  Open source is really
important to us, as we use a lot of it in the building of our product.
As we continue to grow, giving back will become more important.

Interested in helping on both those counts? We need to grow, and
we need to write more great software. We'd love to hear from you.

Whether we look interesting or not, thanks for visiting. Keep Making!

Sincerely,
Lendeavor Engineering
